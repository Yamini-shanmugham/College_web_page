            Reporting activities can help a college better understand your life
            outside of the classroom. Your activities may include arts,
            athletics, clubs, employment, personal commitments, and other
            pursuits. Do you have any activities that you wish to report?” So
            reads the activities section listed on the Common Application, with
            ten options to fill out. Although this is not obviously the only
            portion you answer, it is the portion where students tend to most
            overestimate themselves.<br />
            <br />Exaggerating academics achievement, also known as grades, is a
            clear violation and can easily be caught by colleges checking in
            with your high school. But activities are up to you because you
            choose them and commit to them. For example, making a one-time
            appearance at a club meeting never means that you are its leader,
            let alone its member. Illyssa Gainsley ‘16 explains how, “A lot of
            people have lied saying that they are in clubs that they aren’t
            actually in, which isn't fair.<br />
            <br />I get it though, it is an easy opportunity to add to your
            application, because how is there any consequence for that? College
            counselors should look over it [for regulation].” Another example
            can easily be reflected in sports. Whatever level you play at,
            students are likely to play trump cards of being responsible by
            cleaning up after practice, or being supportive of other members;
            many would just recognize that as “sucking up” to the coaches, and
            putting away a few sports balls doesn't make you a hero.<br />

            <br />A lot of times, we hear and see students taking advantage of
            an opportunity a single time, but never dedicating themselves to it.
            For example, making a one-time appearance at a club meeting never
            means that you are its leader, let alone its member. Another example
